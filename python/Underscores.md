# Underscores in Python

1. \_variable
	- Internal use 
2. for _ in my_arr:
	- It ignores values
3. \__variable
	- Private
4. \__fxn__
	- Overloading operations

Mangling:
- When we put two leading underscores before a variable, this will mangle the attribute names of a class to avoid conflicts of attribute names between classes
