# C++ vs. Java

- Both languages support object oriented programming.

## Integrals Differences

1. **OOP** : C++ allows this, but doesn't only support it. Java is completely and purely object oriented.

2.  **Multiple inheritance** : Java allows, C++ needs special permitions.

3. **Global variables** : Allowed in C++ not Java

4. **Pointers** : C++ supports, Java doesn't

5. **Destruction/Memory management** : Java has automatic garbage collection but C++ needs destructors.

6. **Structs** : Java doesn't support, C++ does

7. **Threads** : Java has built in support for threads, C++ doesn't.

# Interpreted vs. Compiled languages

- Compiled languages are converted to byte-code once by the compiler.
- Interpreted languages are translated into machine understandable code during runtime.
- Interpreted languages are slower since they need to be translated each time.
- Compiled languages are much more efficient since only one translation is required.
